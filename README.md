# FBF-algorithm
===
<br>
DetectMain.java is the main program of FBF algorithm. The implementation classes are all in the utils package.\<br>
<br>
Gogo.java is used to calculate the result. It compared the result image which calculated by detectmain.java with that in groundtruth, and calculated the metrics of CDNet2014.\<br>
Main.java is used to integrate all the txt results into the CSV, which is more convenient for comparison.\<br>
Other files are not important, they are mostly used to generate a single TXT file or CSV file.\<br>
